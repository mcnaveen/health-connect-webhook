![HC Webhook](image.png)

An Android application that seamlessly connects Health Connect data to your webhooks, enabling automated health data synchronization to your custom endpoints.

## Overview

HC Webhook is a powerful Android app that bridges the gap between Google Health Connect and your webhook infrastructure. It automatically reads health data from Health Connect and sends it to your configured webhook URLs at customizable intervals, making it easy to integrate health data into your own systems, analytics platforms, or third-party services.

## Features

- 🔄 **Automated Background Sync** - Configurable sync intervals (minimum 15 minutes) using WorkManager
- 🎯 **Selective Data Types** - Choose which health data types to sync (17 supported types)
- 🔗 **Multiple Webhooks** - Send data to multiple webhook URLs simultaneously
- 📊 **Manual Sync** - Trigger immediate data synchronization on demand
- 📝 **Webhook Logs** - View detailed logs of all webhook requests and responses
- 🔐 **Permission Management** - Granular Health Connect permission handling
- 🎨 **Modern UI** - Built with Jetpack Compose and Material 3 design
- ⚡ **Real-time Status** - Visual indicators for permission status and sync state

1. **Steps** - Daily step count
2. **Sleep** - Sleep sessions with stages
3. **Heart Rate** - Heart rate measurements
4. **Distance** - Distance traveled
5. **Active Calories** - Calories burned during activity
6. **Total Calories** - Total calories burned
7. **Weight** - Body weight measurements
8. **Height** - Height measurements
9. **Blood Pressure** - Systolic and diastolic readings
10. **Blood Glucose** - Blood glucose levels
11. **Oxygen Saturation** - SpO2 measurements
12. **Body Temperature** - Body temperature readings
13. **Respiratory Rate** - Breathing rate measurements
14. **Resting Heart Rate** - Resting heart rate data
15. **Exercise Sessions** - Workout and exercise data
16. **Hydration** - Water intake tracking
17. **Nutrition** - Nutritional information (calories, protein, carbs, fat)

## Requirements

- **Google Health Connect** app installed and set up
- **Internet connection** for webhook delivery

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HC-Webhook.git
cd HC-Webhook
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio (Arctic Fox or later recommended)

3. Sync Gradle dependencies

### Building the APK

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be generated at: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Install Health Connect** (if not already installed)
   - Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata)

2. **Grant Permissions**
   - Open the app and tap "Grant Permissions"
   - Select the health data types you want to sync
   - Grant the required permissions in Health Connect

3. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Add one or more webhook URLs (must start with `http://` or `https://`)
   - Select which data types to sync
   - Set your preferred sync interval (minimum 15 minutes)

4. **Save Configuration**
   - Tap "Save Configuration" to start automatic syncing

### Manual Sync

- Tap the "Sync Now" button in the Manual Sync section to immediately sync all enabled data types to your webhooks

### Viewing Logs

- Access webhook logs from the menu (⋮) → "Webhook Log"
- View detailed information about each webhook request, including timestamps, status codes, and response data

## Configuration

### Sync Interval

- Minimum: 15 minutes
- Recommended: 30-60 minutes for most use cases
- The app uses WorkManager for reliable background syncing

### Webhook Format

The app sends health data to your webhooks in JSON format. Each webhook request includes:

- Timestamp of the sync
- Data type information
- Health data records (filtered to only include new data since last sync)
- Metadata about the sync operation

### Data Privacy

- All health data remains on your device until explicitly sent to your configured webhooks
- The app only reads data that you explicitly grant permission for
- No data is sent to third-party services except your configured webhooks
- You can revoke permissions at any time through Android settings

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **UI Framework**: Jetpack Compose
- **Health Data**: Health Connect SDK (AndroidX)
- **Background Work**: WorkManager
- **Networking**: OkHttp
- **Serialization**: Kotlinx Serialization

### Key Components

- `MainActivity` - Main configuration UI
- `HealthConnectManager` - Handles Health Connect data reading
- `SyncManager` - Manages data synchronization logic
- `SyncWorker` - Background worker for periodic syncing
- `WebhookManager` - Handles webhook HTTP requests
- `PreferencesManager` - Manages app configuration and preferences
- `LogsActivity` - Displays webhook request/response logs

### Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:
