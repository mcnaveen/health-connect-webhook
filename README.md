# Health Connect to Webhook (Beta)

![HC Webhook](image.png)

An Android app that bridges Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, and other health apps to your webhooks via Health Connect APIs, enabling seamless integration with your custom endpoints and services.

## Overview

HC Webhook connects Google Health Connect to your webhook infrastructure. Health Connect aggregates health data from apps like Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, and more into a unified API. This app reads that aggregated data and sends it to your configured webhook URLs at customizable intervals, making it easy to integrate health data from multiple sources into your own systems, analytics platforms, or third-party services.

## How It Works

1. **Health Apps** (Google Fit, Samsung Health, Fitbit, etc.) sync data to **Health Connect**
2. **Health Connect** aggregates all health data into a unified API
3. **HC Webhook** reads data from Health Connect at configured intervals
4. **HC Webhook** sends the data to your configured **webhook URLs**
5. Your **custom services** receive and process the health data

## Supported Health Apps

Health Connect aggregates data from these popular health and fitness apps:

- **Google Fit** - Activity tracking, workouts, and health metrics
- **Samsung Health** - Comprehensive health and fitness tracking
- **Fitbit** - Activity, sleep, and heart rate data
- **MyFitnessPal** - Nutrition and calorie tracking
- **Strava** - Running and cycling activities
- **Nike Run Club** - Running activities and workouts
- **Withings** - Weight, blood pressure, and activity tracking
- **Garmin Connect** - Fitness and health data from Garmin devices
- **Polar** - Heart rate and fitness tracking
- **Oura** - Sleep, activity, and recovery data
- **And many more...** - Any app that syncs to Health Connect

> **Note**: You don't need to install all these apps. Just ensure the apps you use are syncing their data to Health Connect, and HC Webhook will automatically access that unified data.

The APK will be generated at: `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## Usage

### Initial Setup

1. **Install Health Connect** (if not already installed)
   - Download from [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.healthdata)

2. **Grant Permissions**
   - Open the app and tap "Grant Permissions"
   - Select the health data types you want to sync
   - Grant the required permissions in Health Connect

3. **Configure Webhooks**
   - Add one or more webhook URLs (must start with `http://` or `https://`)
   - Select which data types to sync
   - Set your preferred sync interval (minimum 15 minutes)

4. **Save Configuration**
   - Tap "Save Configuration" to start automatic syncing

### Manual Sync

- Tap the "Sync Now" button in the Manual Sync section to immediately sync all enabled data types to your webhooks

### Viewing Logs

- Access webhook logs from the menu (⋮) → "Webhook Log"
- View detailed information about each webhook request, including timestamps, status codes, and response data

### Providing Feedback

- Access the feedback form from the menu (⋮) → "Feedback"
- Share your thoughts, suggestions, or report issues directly through the feedback portal

## Configuration

### Sync Interval

- Minimum: 15 minutes
- Recommended: 30-60 minutes for most use cases
- The app uses WorkManager for reliable background syncing

### Webhook Format

The app sends health data to your webhooks in JSON format. Each webhook request includes:

- Timestamp of the sync
- Data type information
- Health data records (filtered to only include new data since last sync)
- Metadata about the sync operation

> **⚠️ Warning**: Internet retry functionality is not implemented yet. If a webhook request fails due to network issues, the app will not automatically retry. Use at your own risk.

### Data Privacy

- All health data remains on your device until explicitly sent to your configured webhooks
- The app only reads data that you explicitly grant permission for
- No data is sent to third-party services except your configured webhooks
- You can revoke permissions at any time through Android settings

## Known Limitations

- ⚠️ **Offline Handling** - The app attempts to retry failed webhook requests briefly (3 retries). If the internet is unavailable, the sync will fail safely without data loss. The data will be automatically retried during the next scheduled sync interval.
- 🕒 **48-Hour Lookback** - To ensure performance and relevance, the app scans for health data within a rolling 48-hour window. Data older than 48 hours may not be synced if the app was not running or configured during that time.
